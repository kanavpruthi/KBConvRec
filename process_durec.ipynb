      "REPLACING    [3] He sings as good as acting. I'd like to recommend the song @53 to you. As the theme song of the movie @53 and written by Zhan Huang, it presents the feature of classical style with the rippling streams in the woods, the fair-sounding melody of Qin, and flute upstairs. Besides, Leslie Cheung performed it just properly, making the song melodious and far-reaching.\n",

      "REPLACING    [3] His movie is very good. I recommend his @60, which is based on Jin Yong's original martial arts novel, adding the story of eunuch persecuting the faithful guy in King Hu's style. At the same time, it also combines Tsui Hark's cynical political criticism and Xiaodong Cheng's eye-catching martial arts design scenes. After its publication, @60 is recognized the vast majority of film fans, and has been called \"new model of martial arts movies\" by various film critics.\n",

      "REPLACING    [5] Since you like Elder @13 so much, I recommend you his @86. Leslie Cheung gradually showed his acting skills in the movie, especially when Rick, the role he played, turned from a lovestruck man to a crazy killer. This cold-blooded role of Rick also shows the fortitude of men.\n",

As the theme song of the movie  @53, written by James Wong, the song displays fullyof  the classical style, with streams flowing in the woods, piano and flute played from upstairs, with Leslie Cheung's just appropriate singing.
